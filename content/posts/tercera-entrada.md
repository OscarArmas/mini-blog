As the first ML Engineer in the region, my role wasn't just about code—it was about culture.

## Bridging the Gap

Data Scientists are excellent at statistics but often lack software engineering rigour. My goal was to bridge this gap without stifling creativity.

### Initiatives

- **RFC Process**: We implemented a "Request for Comments" process for all major architectural decisions.
- **Pair Programming**: Weekly sessions where engineers and scientists pair up to refactor notebook code into production-grade modules.
- **Post-Mortems**: Blameless retrospectives for every production incident.

> "Culture is what happens when you're not in the room."

By establishing these practices, we scaled from 1 to 4 distributed squads while maintaining code quality.
